## 📌 Project Overview

**Project Name:** FaceID API

**Purpose:** To provide a face recognition API for authenticating users based on facial images.

**Target Users:** Organizations and companies requiring biometric access control for secure physical spaces.

## ✅ Functional Requirements

### 1. **User Management (Companies & Admins)**

* [ ] Register a company (organization) account.
* [ ] Login/Logout functionality.
* [ ] Manage API keys for secure access.
* [ ] Role-based access: Admin, Staff, etc.

### 2. **Face Enrollment**

* [ ] Upload user facial images.

    * Accept formats: JPEG, PNG
    * Perform face detection and encoding on upload
* [ ] Store metadata (user ID, full name, tags)
* [ ] Prevent duplicate entries using facial similarity checks
* [ ] Support optional user reference images (e.g., employee ID)

### 3. **Face Search / Recognition**

* [ ] Accept a new facial image and return best matches from enrolled database
* [ ] Configurable threshold for match confidence (e.g., 85%)
* [ ] Return user metadata of the closest match (if match is above threshold)
* [ ] Option to limit search to specific company or group

### 4. **Access Logging**

* [ ] Log all recognition attempts (success/failure)
* [ ] Include timestamp, location (optional), and image hash
* [ ] Allow companies to view logs per user or per time period

### 5. **API Endpoints**

* [ ] `POST /register` – Register a company
* [ ] `POST /login` – Authenticate and get token
* [ ] `POST /face/enroll` – Upload and register a face
* [ ] `POST /face/search` – Search for a match
* [ ] `GET /logs` – Retrieve access logs
* [ ] `GET /faces/:id` – Get metadata for a face
* [ ] `DELETE /faces/:id` – Remove a face

## 📦 Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

* [ ] Response time < 1 second for face search
* [ ] Scalable to millions of face embeddings

### Security

* [ ] API key or token-based authentication
* [ ] HTTPS only
* [ ] Encrypt facial data at rest
* [ ] Rate limiting and abuse protection
* [ ] Audit logs and access control per company

### Storage

* [ ] Store face embeddings, not just images (use vector storage for fast search)
* [ ] Store original images securely, optionally purge after processing

### Availability

* [ ] 99.9% uptime
* [ ] Horizontal scaling for API and search engine

## ⚙️ Tech Stack Suggestions

* **Backend**: Python (FastAPI or Flask)
* **Face Recognition**: Dlib, FaceNet, or DeepFace
* **Database**: PostgreSQL (metadata), Redis (caching), and FAISS/Weaviate for vector search
* **Storage**: S3-compatible object store (e.g., MinIO)
* **Authentication**: OAuth2 + JWT or API Keys
* **Deployment**: Dockerized containers, scalable via Kubernetes or Docker Swarm

---

## 🧪 Testing & QA

* [ ] Unit tests for all endpoints
* [ ] Mocked face uploads in test suite
* [ ] Load testing for search performance
* [ ] Face recognition accuracy benchmarking
